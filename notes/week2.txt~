Agile development

Iterative and incremental development. It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development and delivery, a time-boxed iterative approach, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change.

Scrum

Scrum is an iterative and incremental Agile software development framework for managing software projects and product or application development.

Each day during the sprint, a project team communication meeting occurs. This is called a Daily Scrum:

- All members of the development team come prepared with the updates for the meeting.
- The meeting starts precisely on time even if some development team members are missing.
- The meeting should happen at the same location and same time every day.
- The meeting length is set (timeboxed) to 15 minutes.
- All are welcome, but normally only the core roles speak.

During the meeting, each team member answers three questions:

- What have you done since yesterday?
- What are you planning to do today?
- Any impediments? stuck?

Sprint

A sprint is a get-together of people involved in a project to give a focused development on the project. Sprints are typically two to seven days long.
Sprints can vary in focus. During some sprints people new to the project are welcomed and get an intensive hands-on introduction pairing with an experienced project member. The first part of such sprints is usually spent getting ready, presenting the tutorials, getting the network setup and ensuring that configuration/source control software and processes are installed and followed.
A significant benefit of sprinting is that the project members meet in person, socialize, and start to communicate more effectively than when working together remotely.

End meetings

At the end of a sprint cycle, two meetings are held: the "Sprint Review Meeting" and the "Sprint Retrospective".
- At the Sprint Review Meeting:
- Review the work that was completed and the planned work that was not completed
- Present the completed work to the stakeholders (a.k.a. "the demo")
- Incomplete work cannot be demonstrated
- Four-hour time limit

At the Sprint Retrospective:
- All team members reflect on the past sprint
- Make continuous process improvements
- Two main questions are asked in the sprint retrospective: What went well during the sprint? What could be improved in the next sprint?
- Three-hour time limit
- This meeting is facilitated by the Scrum Master
